                    <h3>Introduction to Programming Concepts</h3>
                    <p>Knowing the basics of one programming language is very important so that the programmer is able to implement the logic they want without running into any issues</p>
                </div>
                <div class="timeline-date">Step 1</div>

                <div class="timeline-content">
                    <h3>Data Structures Fundamentals</h3>
                    <p>The knowledge of data structures is very important as they are what makes the huge amounts of test case data manageable</p>
                </div>
                <div class="timeline-date">Step 2</div>

                    <h3>Algorithms</h3>
                    <p>The knowledge of popular and most used algorithms comes in very handy once an individual reaches a decent level in competitive coding. Algorithms like sorting and searching are used from the very lower levels of competitive programming</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Giving contests</h3>
                    <p>There is no end to learning of data stuctures and specifically algorithms but it would all be in vein if the programmer is not able to implement them in problem solving and thus they are recomended to start giving contests on competitive programming websites as soon as they are familiar with the basics of all the above mentioned topics</p>
                </div>
                <div class="timeline-date">Step 4</div>

                <div class="timeline-content">
                    <h3>Upsolving problems</h3>
                    <p>The most important step in the journey of a competitive programmer is to UPSOLVE contest problems. Upsolving problems means solving atleast 1 extra problem after every contest which they weren't able to solve during the contest time. They can look into hints if they are stuck</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Thank us</h3>
                    <p>If one follows these steps and maintains consistency, no one will be able to stop them from climbing up the rating ladder and then they will for sure return and thank us for showing them the way</p>
